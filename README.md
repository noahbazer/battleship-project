# battleship-project

This is multi-part battleship project, built as my Devslopes final ES6 Javscript curriculum project.

I initially wasn't going to make a repository for this, but halfway through the second part,
I was so graciously pestered by a full-stack developer friend of mine to get on it. 
Since then I've committed almost every change, and pushed almost every session.
There are a few quality of life features per part that I want to highlight:

PART 1:
- Intuitive input validifier system
- Scalable board size (in preparation for part two)

PART 2:
- Includes infinite* number of ships (editable by the shipLengths array)
- Randomized ship placement location and orientation
- Efficient testing loops keep program lightweight
- Chalk program color-codes certain actions to make reading through terminal easier
- "ships" input allowes user to see how many ships are remaining
- Small continuity cases to keep grammar and interactions consistent and clean
